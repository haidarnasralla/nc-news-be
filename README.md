You'll want to set up environment variables before you run this locally.

Follow the following steps!

1. Make sure you've run "npm install" in the command line to install dev dependencies. 
2. Create 2 files in the home directory called ".env.development" and "env.test" for the project. Add the line "PGDATABASE=" followed by "nc_news" and "nc_news_test", respectively.
3. Check the ".gitignore" file ignores .env files by checking that ".env.*" is there.
